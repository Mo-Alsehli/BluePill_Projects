# STM32 Master I2C Communicates (R/W) With EEPROM As A Slave.
**This Project Utilizes an I2C Controller To Read and Write data On EEPROM Memory**
![I2C](https://github.com/Mo-Alsehli/STM32F103_Projects/assets/98949843/20978cb5-882c-4adc-9861-3f563260f42c)

### Procedure
- Writing the driver in the MCAL for the I2C controller on STM32F103C6.
- Writing the driver in the HAL for the EEPROM memory.
- Write the right application for the system to read and write data in the EEPROM.

### Simulation
#### 1- Keil Simulation For STM32 as a Master And For EEPROM As a Slave:
