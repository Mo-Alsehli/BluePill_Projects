# UART Send Character Project With Bluepill board
**This Project uses UART1 in STM32 microcontroller to send and receive a character with polling mechanism and interrupt mechanism and using Keil Micro-vision simulation**

### Procedure
- I have made the drivers for the UART and RCC for stm32f103c8 using its specs in the MCAL Layer.
- Then I made the right application layer for those drivers.
- In the application layer I made two mechanisms, One using a polling mechanism and another one with an interrupt mechanism.

### Simulation
